# CIFAR-10 Image Retrieval with PyTorch and Pinecone

This project demonstrates an image similarity search system using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a ResNet-based feature extractor, and Pinecone for vector indexing and retrieval.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Uses `ResNet18` to extract feature vectors
- Stores feature vectors in Pinecone
- Performs similarity-based image retrieval
- Visualizes query and retrieved images

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- OpenCV
- Pinecone
- Matplotlib
